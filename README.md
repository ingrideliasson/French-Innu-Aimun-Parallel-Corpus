# French-Innu-Aimun-Parallel-Corpus
This is a unique parallel corpus for the North American Indigenous language Innu-Aimun and French. 
The corpus contains 2403 parallel sentences between French and Innu-Aimun. 
All data was collected from a public resource, published by the FNQLSDI: https://fnqlsdi.ca/multilingual-books/
The data has been extracted and manually aligned by me, as part of a course project. 
The purpose of the corpus is to enable further research on the low resource and highly inflectional language Innu-Aimun. 
Note: I am not a native speaker nor a member of the Indigenous community.
